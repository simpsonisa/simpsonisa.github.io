    In building this portfolio site I’ve gotten to work
with a variety of smaller grids, and have no become a 
lot more conscious of the issues that may arise when grid 
building for a webpage. I’ve also, through trial and error, 
become much more aware of what will and wont easily transfer 
to a mobile screen. 
    Overall when building this project the major 
issues that generally arose had to do with the sites reaction
 to changing window/screen size. Even though there’s still some 
 issues particularly with alignment on mobile, this whole 
 project has been a huge learning experience on responsive 
 content and grid building.
